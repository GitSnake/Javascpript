// Keep track of the questions answered correctly & incorrectly


// Display the correct & incorrect questions in separate lists


// Build a two dimensional array to hold the questions & answers


// Each element of the array represents one question & is an array composed of two elements. The question & answer


// Use a loop to cycle through each question


// Ask it using prompt, compare the response from the player to the answer in the array


// Use an if statement to see if the player's answer matches the real answer


// Loop finishes, you should know how many questions were correctly answered


// Then print that out to the screen.
