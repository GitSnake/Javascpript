// It will ask a series of questions and evaluate each answer.


// The program should keep track of the number of questions answered correctly.


// After all the questions are answered the program should display the number of questions that were correctly answered.


// And the number that the player got wrong.


// You'll use a few concepts from this course to get this done.


// First a two dimensional array.


// You should use a two dimensional array to hold the questions and the answers.

// Each element of the array represents one question and is itself an array composed of two elements. The question and the answer.


// Create a two dimensional array with at least three questions in it.


// You'll also use a loop.


// You'll need to use a loop to cycle through each question.


// Ask it, and compare the response from the player to the answer in the array.


// You can use the prompt method to ask the question.


// See the teacher's notes if you're not sure how the prompt method works.


// You'll then use a conditional statement to see if the player's answer


// matches the real answer.


// When the loop is done, you should know how many questions were correctly answered.


// So print that out to the screen.
